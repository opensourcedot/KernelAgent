Generate a comprehensive test for a Triton kernel based on the following problem description:

{{ problem_description }}

{% if provided_test_code -%}
REFERENCE TEST CODE:
The user has provided the following test code as reference. Use this to understand the expected behavior and requirements, but generate a new test that follows our standardized format:

```python
{{ provided_test_code }}
```

IMPORTANT: Do NOT copy the reference test directly. Instead, analyze it to understand:
- What inputs and outputs are expected
- What the kernel should compute
- Any specific requirements or edge cases
- Expected data types and shapes
- If original problem description specifies FP32, convert to BF16 problems, never use FP32
- Do NOT compute expected result in FP32 then cast back to BF16
- Use BF16 for all if the problem description specifies FP32, including computation
- The highest precision for the test is BF16, again DO NOT use FP32 for reference computation
- Add a summary comment of the original problem description in the test code

Then generate a new test following our format requirements below.
{%- endif %}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. The test must be a complete, valid Python file
2. Import the kernel function using: from kernel import kernel_function
3. Call kernel_function as a NORMAL PYTHON FUNCTION (no grid configuration or kernel launch)
4. The kernel.py file will handle all Triton-specific launch logic internally
5. Create appropriate test data (e.g., torch tensors on CUDA device)
6. Pass test data to kernel_function as regular function arguments
7. Verify the results are correct
8. Return True if test passes, False if it fails
9. Exit with code 0 on success, 1 on failure
10. Include error messages and debugging output
11. Handle exceptions gracefully
12. If the problem description includes a Reference PyTorch implementation (a function named `reference` or equivalent), CALL IT to compute the expected output

CRITICAL TEST DATA REQUIREMENTS:
- If the problem description specifies exact shapes, dtypes, or tensor dimensions, use EXACTLY those specifications
- Do NOT create multiple test cases with different shapes/dtypes if specific ones are mentioned
- Use the exact shapes and dtypes mentioned in the problem description
- Use non-zero random tensors (e.g., torch.randn/torch.rand) for inputs; never feed all-zero data unless the problem explicitly requires it, because zero inputs can hide missing computation.
- Only create variations if the problem description is vague about the input specifications
- If original problem description specifies FP32, convert to BF16 problems instead of FP32 problems
- AVOID FP32 for inputs and outputs - use BF16 instead when users specify FP32 problems

DEBUGGING REQUIREMENTS:
- When numerical results are incorrect, print detailed debugging information including:
  - Expected vs actual output values (or samples if large)
  - Input tensor shapes, dtypes, and sample values
  - Any intermediate results that can help identify the issue
  - Use torch.allclose() with appropriate tolerances for floating point comparisons
- Include try/except blocks around numerical comparisons to catch and debug assertion errors

NUMERICAL TOLERANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Use DEFAULT tolerances: rtol=1e-3, atol=1e-3 for torch.allclose()
- Adjust tolerances ONLY if needed based on:
  - Input data type (float16 may need looser tolerances like rtol=1e-2, atol=1e-2)
  - Input value ranges (very large or very small values may need adjusted tolerances)
  - Specific algorithm characteristics (iterative algorithms may accumulate more error)
  - If accumulation dimension is very large, use much larger tolerances, like 1e-1
- Always document in comments why non-default tolerances are used

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use any Triton kernel launch syntax. Treat kernel_function as a regular Python function.

The test file structure should be:
```python
import torch
# other imports as needed (but NOT triton - that's handled in kernel.py)

# Comment for summary of original problem description
def test_kernel():
    """Test the kernel implementation."""
    try:
        from kernel import kernel_function
        
        # Create test data using EXACT specifications from problem description
        # If problem specifies shape/dtype, use those exact values
        # input_tensor = torch.randn(EXACT_SHAPE, dtype=EXACT_DTYPE, device='cuda')
        
        # Call kernel_function as a normal Python function
        # result = kernel_function(input_tensor, other_args...)
        
        # Verify results with detailed debugging on failure
        # Use default tolerances: rtol=1e-3, atol=1e-3
        # Adjust only if needed based on dtype/range (document why)
        #
        # Examples of when to adjust tolerances:
        # - For float16: rtol=1e-2, atol=1e-2  # Lower precision
        # - For very large values (>1e6): rtol=1e-2, atol=1e-1  # Larger absolute errors expected
        # - For iterative algorithms: rtol=1e-2, atol=1e-2  # Accumulation of errors
        #
        # if not torch.allclose(result, expected, rtol=1e-3, atol=1e-3):
        #     print(f"NUMERICAL MISMATCH:")
        #     print(f"Input shape: {input_tensor.shape}, dtype: {input_tensor.dtype}")
        #     print(f"Expected shape: {expected.shape}, dtype: {expected.dtype}")
        #     print(f"Result shape: {result.shape}, dtype: {result.dtype}")
        #     print(f"Expected (first few): {expected.flatten()[:10]}")
        #     print(f"Got (first few): {result.flatten()[:10]}")
        #     print(f"Max absolute difference: {torch.max(torch.abs(result - expected))}")
        #     print(f"Relative error: {torch.max(torch.abs((result - expected) / (expected + 1e-8)))}")
        #     return False
        
        return True  # if successful
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Test failed: {e}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    success = test_kernel()
    sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```
